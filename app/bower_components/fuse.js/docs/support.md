# Sponsor Fuse.js Development

If you use Fuse.js in your daily work and feel that it has made your life easier, please consider sponsorship. It’s like buying me a coffee once in a while! ☕️ If you run a business that is using Fuse.js, it makes sense to sponsor its development: **it ensures the project stays healthy and actively maintained.**

Also, you will be recognized as a beacon of support to open-source developers everywhere.
