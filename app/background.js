// Service Worker for Tab Ahead
// This replaces the background page (bg.html) in Manifest V3

// The service worker will be installed and activated automatically
// No specific background functionality is needed for this extension
// as the popup handles all the tab querying and switching logic

console.log('Tab Ahead service worker loaded');

// Optional: Add any background functionality here if needed in the future
// For example, listening for tab events, managing extension state, etc.
